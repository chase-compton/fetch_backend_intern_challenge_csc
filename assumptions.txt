I wanted to track any and all assumptions that I made during my development. 
I did this in order to hopefully provide some context to some of the design choices I made in the application.

Assumptions:
  I assumed that adding negative points was valid based on the example solution provided.
  However, I assumed that adding negative points was only valid as long as the payer's balance remained positive based on the description in the spend endpoint.
  While the add endpoint did not specifically state this, I decided to do it based on the "use your best judgment" instruction outlined in the FAQs
