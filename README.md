# Points Tracker API

This repository contains a simple Flask application that implements an API for a points tracker system. The API allows users to add points, spend points, and retrieve the points balance by payer.

## How to Use

To run this application and test the API, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Python and pip installed on your system.

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install flask
3. Clone the repo
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
4. Navigate to the repo's location
   ```bash
   cd <repository_name>
5. Run the application
   ```bash
   python app.py
6. At this point the application is up and running. You can test it using Postman or cURL. For example, here is the add endpoint with a cURL command:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"payer": "DANNON", "points": 300, "timestamp": "2022-10-31T10:00:00Z"}' http://localhost:8000/add

## Testing

   ```bash
   python app.py
2. In a separate terminal, use the following command to run the sample solution provided in the instructions
